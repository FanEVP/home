		<p>A multitude of different techniques are demonstrated in fencing, although some types are more common and/or only applicable to certain forms of the sport. These attacks usually fall into the category of either offensive or defensive, as listed below.</p>
		<h2 class= "heading">Offensive Techniques</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>En garde: Although not technically an action, it is important to master the en garde position and be able to demonstrate it with good form. En garde is the position that athletes must start in. The fencer starts with their sword arm and the corresponding leg in front, with their foot pointed forward. The back foot is positioned about shoulder&#39;s width apart from the front foot, and it points outwards, so that the feet would make an L shape if they were brought together. The sword arm is slightly bent; the forearm should be close to the torso, and the lower arm is parallel to the ground. The tip of the sword should be at roughly shoulder level (foil), a bit above the top of the head (sabre), or parallel to the ground (&eacute;p&eacute;e). The other arm is behind the torso, out of the way, held at either waist level or shoulder level. Finally, the fencer&#39;s weight should be evenly distributed so they are able to easily move forward or backward without transferring their weight first.</li>
			<li>Moving forward and back: When moving, your feet should generally not cross each other. It is important to maintain en garde position as much as possible while inching up and down the piste, without needlessly transferring your weight. If you are moving forward, each step begins with moving your front foot forward, and then stepping up with your back foot to maintain a good distance. If you are moving backward, the back foot always takes the first step. It is important not to take large steps, as they are harder to recover from.</li>
			<li>Attack (a.k.a. thrust): One of the most basic techniques, it involves simply extending your sword arm to threaten your opponent&#39;s target area. This can also be seen in a slashing motion with sabre fencing.</li>
			<li>Riposte: A counterattack that can be made by the defender after successfully parrying the attacker.</li>
			<li>Feint: An attack meant to threaten your opponent and cause them to take action.</li>
			<li>Lunge: Often, simply attacking is not enough to score a point; it is unlikely to be able to safely get close enough to your opponent to execute an attack. Lunging is an action where you extend your front leg to quickly bring yourself closer to your opponent, while you extend your sword arm. The back arm should also extend behind a fencer, to provide stability and extra thrust moving forwards. When the front foot steps forward, it should aim to shoot a bit farther, so that when the knee bends to create a 90 degree angle, the back foot should be dragged forward a few centimetres rather than remaining in place.</li>
			<li>Beat Attack: Beating means hitting your opponent&#39;s blade out of the way. This can be used to gain priority when your opponent is stalling (in sabre and foil), or to distract your opponent and take down their defenses (in &eacute;p&eacute;e).</li>
			<li>Disengage: This is a technique used to avoid being parried. It involves extending your sword arm, and circling the tip of your blade under your opponent&#39;s halfway through, making them parry in the wrong direction. Double disengages are also common, where you circle under your opponent&#39;s blade before extending, and then circle back again halfway through your attack. When disengaging, the movement of the tip of the blade and the fencer&#39;s wrist should be minimal, so it is more difficult for their opponent to predict their attack and counter it.</li>
			<li>Continuation of Attack: An &eacute;p&eacute;e technique where a second attack is attempted after the first one is parried.</li>
			<li>Remise: In foil or sabre, a second attack after the first one misses. It is considered to have lost <a href= "rules_scoring.html#right_of_way" target= "_blank">right of way</a>, and a riposte will always score over a remise.</li>
			<li>Flick: A foil technique where the blade is intentionally bent like a whip, letting it curve past the defense and strike the opponent.</li>
			<li>Fl&egrave;che: A technique used in foil and &eacute;p&eacute;e where during the attack, the fencer&#39;s weight is initially on their front foot, before their back foot crosses to the front.</li>
			<li>Flunge: Similar to the fl&egrave;che, except the back leg does not cross in front. It is used in sabre in place of the fl&egrave;che, because crossing your feet is not legal in sabre fencing.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class= "heading">Defensive Techniques</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Parry: The most basic defensive action, involving moving your opponent&#39;s blade out of the valid target area and gaining the right of way. While parrying, the forearm should not move, and the lower arm should only move as much as it needs to, so the fencer can quickly recover should they need to parry in another direction. </li>
			<li>Circular parry: Similar to the parry, but the blade moves in a circular motion rather than moving side to side. It is commonly used to parry disengages.</li>
			<li>Counter attack: Attacking by extending your arm while moving back, away from your opponent.</li>
		</ul>
