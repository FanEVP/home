		<p>Fencing is a sport where two opponents spar using swords while moving back and forth on a thin piste. It evolved around traditional swordsmanship skills in medieval Europe. Nowadays, there are three branches: foil, sabre, and &eacute;p&eacute;e, which will be explored more in depth later. Competitive fencing is governed by the <a href= "http://fie.org/" target= "_blank">FIE</a> (International Fencing Federation in English, or F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale d'Escrime in French).</p>

		<h1 class= "heading"> Equipment </h1>
		<p>There are three main forms of modern fencing, as mentioned previously. Each of these forms require a different blade, which may be heavier, longer, or simply have a different function. Fencers are also required to wear certain gear, some of it specific to electric fencing. The typical protective gear is made of heavy cotton or nylon, while electric-specific equipment is made of metal (or metallic meshes in the case of wearables) in order to complete the circuit that is used for scoring. <a href= "equipment.html" target= "_blank">Read more.</a> </p>
		<h1 class= "heading">Techniques</h1>
		<p>There are many different techniques used by fencers, and this variety and the ability to create so many unique sequences of attacks allows for creative ways to score points and win bouts. This is not only entertaining for the audience to watch, but also necessary in order for a fencer to grow physically and strategically. The spontaneity of these offensive and defensive maneuvers is a huge part of what makes fencing unique from other sports. Though some techniques are weapon-specific, most can be seen used in all three forms of fencing, being used by athletes of all different abilities and experiences. <a href= "techniques.html" target= "_blank">Read more.</a> </p>
		<h1 class= "heading">Rules and Scoring</h1>
		<p>Like all sports, fencing is governed by a set of rules that maintain order in madness. The basic goal of fencing is to score a certain number of hits against your opponent within a certain time limit. Bouts take place on a 14m long conductive piste. The three different types of fencing have different valid target areas and some different specifications. While the general rule is that whichever fencer scores first earns the point, there are exceptions. Additionally, there are specific rules which, if broken, could result in a warning, penalty, or even expulsion from a tournament. <a href= "rules_scoring.html" target= "_blank">Read more.</a> </p>
