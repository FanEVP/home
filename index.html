		<h1>Introduction to Fencing</h1>
		<p>Fencing is a sport where two opponents spar using swords while moving back and forth on a thin piste. It evolved around traditional swordsmanship skills in medieval Europe. Nowadays, there are three branches: foil, sabre, and &eacute;p&eacute;e, which will be explored more in depth later. Competitive fencing is governed by the <a href= "http://fie.org/">FIE</a> (International Fencing Federation in English, or F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale d'Escrime in French).</p>

		<h1> Equipment </h1>
		<!-- Come back later and add pictures -->
		Like all other sports, there are potential physical risks that one must be aware of when participating. In order to conform to regulations and ensure their own safety, fencers are required to wear specific equipment. Most of the items listed, often referred to as "whites," are usually made of nylon or heavy cotton.
		<h2>Clothing</h2>
		<!--Bold all equipment names later in CSS-->
		<p>The first piece of clothing that a fencer wears is the chest protector. It is a hard plastic breast plate that is worn by women and some men. It is also worn by instructors, because they are hit more than their students during one on one training.</p>
		<p>Second, knickers are worn to protect the thighs. They are essentially overalls that end just below the knees. When wearing knickers, special knee high socks with an extra patch knitted in front of the shins should also be worn.</p>
		<p>The plastron is a mini-jacket that is worn to protect the upper arm of a fencer's sword arm. Due to this, the plastrons for left and right handed fencers are different.</p>
		<p>Fencers wear long sleeved jackets to protect their upper body. The zipper is off to the side, opposite from the sword arm for safety reasons, and there is a strap that passes between the legs in order to prevent an opponent's sword from slipping under the jacket and potentially causing injury. In sabre fencing, jackets are cut off at the waist.</p>
		<p>Gloves, or gauntlets, are worn only on the sword arm. Along with the handguard on a fencer's weapon, they prevent serious injury to the hands. The other arm should be safely out of the way at all times when fencing, so only one glove is required.</p>
		<p>Special fencing shoes do exist, but amateurs and non competitive fencers usually don't wear them. They have reinforced soles that are wear-resistant to lunging.</p>
		<p>Finally, and possibly most importantly, is the mask. A hard metal mesh shaped like a dome guards the fencer's face, and the bib prevents a blade from directly hitting a fencer's neck.</p>
		<h3>Electric equipment</h3> 
		<p>When electric fencing (as opposed to dry fencing), extra equipment is needed. The way these components are worn/connected is explained below.</p>
		<p>First of all, a lam&eacute; is worn over the jacket. It is designed in the same way as the jacket, only it is made of a conductive mesh. Foil lam&eacute;s do not have sleeves, and in &eacute;p&eacute;e fencing, they are not used at all. Conductive bibs (foil and &eacute;p&eacute;e), conductive masks (sabre only), and conductive gloves (sabre only) are also required.</p>
		<p>The most important component for electric fencing is the body wire. It is worn under all of the other equipment. On one end, there are three prongs which is plugged into a reel that is connected to a circuit, and a metal clip which is clipped to the lam&eacute;. The end of the reel has a second clip for the lam&eacute;. The other end of the wire runs through the jacket sleeve and is plugged into the blade. This end of the wire has two prongs for foil and sabre fencing, and three for &eacute;p&eacute;e.</p>

		<h2>Weapons</h2>
		<p>As previously mentioned, there are three types of fencing weapons. Foil blades are the most elementary. They are considered thrusting weapons, which means that only touches scored with the tip of the blade will count. It features a small handguard that exists simply to protect the hand. The &eacute;p&eacute;e could be considered a close relative of the foil. It is typically heavier, with a larger handguard than the foil, as the hand is a valid target area in &eacute;p&eacute;e fencing. As with foil fencing, only hits scored with the tip of the blade register. Finally, we have the sabre. It weighs about the same as a foil, but it is a cutting and thrusting weapon. This means that touches landed using the side of the blade and the tip both count. The sabre handguard extends to where the grip begins, protecting the sword arm from hits.</p>
		<h3>Grips</h3>
		<p>The grip of a blade is the part behind the handguard which you hold. In competitive fencing, only two are commonly used; the pistol and the French. The former is shaped like a gun (hence the name). They are preferred by most foil and &eacute;p&eacute;e fencers, as they offer the stability needed to score using the tip and defend against your opponent. The French grip, though less stable, is more versatile, and allows for a longer reach. It is the only type of grip used in sabre fencing, and is occasionally used by &eacute;p&eacute;e fencers. Other grips, such as the Italian and the Spanish grips, are either not commonly used or not legal in competitive fencing.</p>
		<h1>Rules and Scoring</h1>
		<p>While the three different types of fencing have variations in rules, techniques, and strategies, the basic concept is the same. Two opponents try to hit each other with their blades to earn points while also avoiding being hit. This is done on a piste, which is a 14m long strip, which is 1.5m to 2m wide. Fencers are required to stay on the piste at all times during a match, and a point is awarded to their opponent if they step off without first alerting the referee. The last two metres on either end are marked to warn fencers of the boundaries. The en garde lines, where</p>
