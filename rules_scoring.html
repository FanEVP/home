		<p>While the three different types of fencing have variations in rules, techniques, and strategies, the basic concept is the same. Two opponents try to hit each other with their blades to earn points while also avoiding being hit. This is done on a piste, which is a 14m long strip, which is 1.5m to 2m wide. Fencers are required to stay on the piste at all times during a match, and a point is awarded to their opponent if they step off without first alerting the referee. The last two metres on either end are marked to warn fencers of the boundaries. The en garde lines, where bouts start, are marked 2m from the centre. The centre and certain other points are also marked to warn fencers of the boundaries. A match is won when one player reaches a pre-determined number of points.</p>
		<h2 class= "heading">Foil</h2>
		<p>Many fencers begin with foil, as it is arguably the easiest to build a foundation through. The valid target area is the torso (including the back), meaning that hits to the legs, arms, and head do not count. In foil, only hits made with the tip of the blade count; thus, during electric foil fencing, the sides of the blade are taped. When someone successfully scores a point, both fencers return to the en garde lines. If someone hits off-target, both fencers stop, and they resume where they were standing. If both fencers score a point simultaneously during a bout, referees use a set of rules called the right of way to determine who gets the point. In order to determine who had the right of way, we must know who had priority. This means that the fencer who attacked first has priority. If they failed to score, play continues and their opponent gains priority. Priority transfers back and forth until someone successfully scores.</p>
		<p id= "right_of_way">The right of way can be very complex, but the basic rules are as follows.</p> <!-- right_of_way id is linked to from the remise li element on the techniques page -->
		<p>The fencer who initiated the attack gets the point if:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Their opponent attempts to attack without first parrying to gain priority.</li>
			<li>Their opponent parries but pauses before attempting a riposte.</li>
			<li>Their opponent's blade was beat out of line.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The fencer who was defending gets the point if:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They beat the offense's blade during a compound attack and they proceed anyways.</li>
			<li>The attacker pauses or withdraws their arm during a compound attack.</li>
			<li>Their blade was already in-line.</li>
			<li>They riposte immediately after parrying</li>
		</ul>
		<p>However, if a right of way cannot be determined for whatever reason, it is considered a simultaneous attack, and neither person gets the point.</p>
		<h2 class= "heading">Sabre</h2>
		<p>Sabre is different from &eacute;p&eacute;e and foil in that it is possible to score with the side of the blade as well as the tip. In sabre, the target area is everything waist-up. This includes the head, back, arms, and hands. The same set of right of way rules used in foil fencing is also applied with sabre bouts.</p>
		<h2 class= "heading">&Eacute;p&eacute;e</h2>
		<p>The last form of fencing, &eacute;p&eacute;e, is much less particular than the other two forms when it comes to scoring. The entire body is a valid target area, meaning there is no such thing as an off-target attack. Also, right of way does not matter in sabre; in the event of a simultaneous attack, both fencers get a point.</p>

		It should be noted that if a fencer makes an illegal move or their equipment does not reach regulations, the referee may issue them penalties in the form of yellow, red, and black cards. Some examples of offenses include leaving the piste without the referee's permission, using your non-sword arm, and exhibiting violent and/or malevolent action. Yellow cards are warnings, red cards award the fencer's opponent a penalty touch, and getting a black card leads to exclusion/expulsion from the tournament, although there are <a href= "http://assets.ngin.com/attachments/document/0034/7747/Penalty_Chart_2013.pdf" target= "_blank">more aspects</a> of the penalty system and other offenses as well. </p>
