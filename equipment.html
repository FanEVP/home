		<p>Like all other sports, there are potential physical risks that one must be aware of when participating. In order to conform to regulations and ensure their own safety, fencers are required to wear specific equipment. Most of the items listed, often referred to as "whites," are usually made of nylon or heavy cotton.</p>
		<h2 class= "heading">Clothing</h2>
		<img id= "equ_img" src= "Images/equipment_collage.jpg" alt= "Labelled diagram of all the different clothing items listed" width= "400" height= "300"> <!-- ID used to float image -->
		<p id= "chprotector_p">The first piece of clothing that a fencer wears is the <span id= "chest_protector">chest protector</span>. It is a hard plastic breast plate that is worn by women and some men. It is also worn by instructors, because they are hit more than their students during one on one training.</p>
		<p>Second, <span id= "knickers">knickers</span> are worn to protect the thighs. They are essentially overalls that end just below the knees. When wearing knickers, special knee high <span id= "socks">socks</span> with an extra patch knitted in front of the shins should also be worn.</p>
		<p>The <span id= "plastron">plastron</span> is a mini-jacket that is worn to protect the upper arm of a fencer's sword arm. Due to this, the plastrons for left and right handed fencers are different.</p>
		<p>Fencers wear long sleeved <span id= "jacket">jackets</span> to protect their upper body. The zipper is off to the side, opposite from the sword arm for safety reasons, and there is a strap that passes between the legs in order to prevent an opponent's sword from slipping under the jacket and potentially causing injury. In sabre fencing, jackets are cut off at the waist.</p>
		<p><span id= "glove">Gloves</span>, or gauntlets, are worn only on the sword hand. Along with the handguard on a fencer's weapon, they prevent serious injury to the hands. The other arm should be safely out of the way at all times when fencing, so only one glove is required.</p>
		<p>Special fencing <span id= "shoes">shoes</span> do exist, but they aren't required or needed. They have reinforced soles that are wear-resistant to lunging.</p>
		<p>Finally, and possibly most importantly, is the <span id= "mask">mask</span>. A hard metal mesh shaped like a dome guards the fencer's face, and the bib prevents a blade from directly hitting a fencer's neck.</p>
		<h2 class= "heading">Weapons</h2>
		<p>There are three types of fencing weapons. <span id= "foil">Foil</span> blades are the most elementary. They are considered thrusting weapons, which means that only touches scored with the tip of the blade will count. It features a small handguard that exists simply to protect the hand. The <span id= "epee">&eacute;p&eacute;e</span> could be considered a close relative of the foil. It is typically heavier, with a larger handguard than the foil, as the hand is a valid target area in &eacute;p&eacute;e fencing. As with foil fencing, only hits scored with the tip of the blade register. Lastly, there is the <span id= "sabre">sabre</span>. It weighs about the same as a foil, but it is a cutting and thrusting weapon. This means that touches landed using the side of the blade and the tip both count. The sabre handguard extends to where the grip begins, protecting the sword arm from hits.</p>
		<p>Regular blades, used during practise and "dry" fencing, have tips made of rubber, while blades used for electric fencing end in a flat, circular, metal tip. There is a spring built inside the tip so that pressure can be detected.</p>
		<h3 class= "heading">Grips</h3>
		<img id= "grip_img" src= "Images/grip_collage.jpg" alt= "A side by side comparison of a pistol grip and a French grip." width= "200" height= "150"> <!-- ID used to float image -->
		<p>The grip of a blade is the part behind the handguard which you hold. In competitive fencing, only two are commonly used; the <span id= "pistol">pistol</span> and the <span id= "French">French</span>. The former is shaped like a gun (hence the name). They are preferred by most foil and &eacute;p&eacute;e fencers, as they offer the stability needed to score using the tip and defend against your opponent. The French grip, a simple bar to hold onto, provides less stability, but is more versatile and allows for a longer reach. It is the only type of grip used in sabre fencing, and is occasionally used by &eacute;p&eacute;e fencers. Other grips, such as the Italian and the Spanish grips, are either not commonly used or not legal in competitive fencing.</p>
		
		<h2 class= "heading">Electric equipment</h2> 
		<p>When electric fencing (as opposed to dry fencing), extra equipment is needed. The way these components are worn/connected is explained below.</p>
		<p>First of all, a <span id= "lame">lam&eacute;</span> is worn over the jacket. It is designed in the same way as the jacket, only it is made of a conductive mesh. Foil lam&eacute;s do not have sleeves, and in &eacute;p&eacute;e fencing, they are not used at all. <span id= "con_bib">Conductive bibs</span> (foil and &eacute;p&eacute;e), <span id= "con_mask">conductive masks</span> (sabre only), and <span id= "con_glove">conductive gloves</span> (sabre only) are also required.</p>
		<p>The most important component for electric fencing is the <span id= "wire">body wire</span>. It is worn under all of the other equipment. On one end, there are three prongs which is plugged into a reel that is connected to a circuit, and a metal clip which is clipped to the lam&eacute;. The end of the reel has a second clip for the lam&eacute;. The other end of the wire runs through the jacket sleeve and is plugged into the blade. This end of the wire has two prongs for foil and sabre fencing, and three for &eacute;p&eacute;e.</p>
